### Multy Open Source

Open-source is at the core of Multy. For Multy to succeed, it requires constant feedback from developers. This is so we
can ensure that the abstractions are being done properly and the roadmap for new supported features/services are
prioritised based on community feedback.

If you have any feedback or ways Multy could be better, let us know through our public channels or reach out directly at
hello@multy.dev!

**Join the Multy Community! We are always looking for feedback and contributors!**

**This document is a WIP**

## Contributing

Multy is built on open-source and we are always looking for people to contribute feedback, ideas, fixes, blog posts and
more!

If you are interested in contributing to Multy, here are a few ideas:

üí¨ Join the discussion on our community [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rgaKXY4tCZ)!

üí° Raise any feedback/ideas as a GitHub Issue.

‚≠êÔ∏è Star the repository to spread the word!

The guide will provide you with an overview on Multy projects and how to contribute!

## How to start

To get started, you should first look at the project [overview document](/.github/overview.md) that goes over the folder
structure and how the
project is laid out. For any question, you can always talk to the maintainers on
our [discord server](https://discord.gg/rgaKXY4tCZ). You can also submit an issue to discuss anything with the team!

## Submitting a pull request

PR naming convention is `TYPE: overview-of-pull-request`

When TYPE can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A
standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. Pull the repository to get the latest changes

```bash
$ git pull
```

2. Create new branch from `main` like: `feat-added-brazil-region`

```bash
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat

4. Push changes to GitHub

```bash
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

5. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
6. Start a Pull Request

   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
7. Get a code review approval
8. After approval, merge your PR
9. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).

## Other ways to help

There are plenty of ways to support Multy that don't involve contributing code!
